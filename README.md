### Project Specs

The gametime project allowed us to re-create a popular arcade game using CanvasJS. Objects in the game are created using Class constructor files, and each class should have its own testing file to verify functionality.

The objective of the game is to progess through levels by eliminating all segments of a centipede. Points are accrued on destruction of a centipede segment, eliminating a spider object, and completing a level. Lives are lost when a centipede segment or a spider makes contact with the player. The game ends when all lives are used. Game makes use of a high score feature.
